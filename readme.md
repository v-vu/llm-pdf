# MultiPDF Chat App

## üìñ Introduction

The **MultiPDF Chat App** is a Python application that allows you to **chat with multiple PDF documents**.  
You can ask questions about the PDFs using natural language, and the app will provide relevant responses based on the content of the documents.  

It leverages a language model to generate accurate answers to your queries.  
‚ö†Ô∏è *Note: The app will only respond to questions related to the loaded PDFs.*

## üõ† How It Works

The application follows these steps to provide responses to your questions:

1. **PDF Loading** ‚Äì The app reads multiple PDF documents and extracts their text content.  
2. **Text Chunking** ‚Äì The extracted text is divided into smaller chunks for efficient processing.  
3. **Language Model** ‚Äì The app generates vector representations (embeddings) of the text chunks.  
4. **Similarity Matching** ‚Äì When you ask a question, the app finds the most semantically similar chunks.  
5. **Response Generation** ‚Äì The relevant chunks are passed to the language model, which generates a context-aware response.
